Please put together a simple web server that utilizes calling upon a REST API of your choice.
The web server can be from any framework you'd like, but should be simple to run and boot on a local machine (No need for a front end!)

Ideally, it executes something with a tangible outcome, and should also leverage some webhook or some sort of listener.


We're looking for some practical experience with APIs in the context of a web server.

If you're at a loss on an API to use, here are a few services that have free trials/developer accounts:
